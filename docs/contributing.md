## Workflow

1. Fork [susina/config-builder](https://github.com/susina/config-builder) repository, clone it locally and apply your patches.
2. Run the test suite by `composer test` command and fix all red tests.
3. Run static analysis tool by `composer analytics` command and fix all errors.
4. Fix the coding standard by running `composer cs:fix`.

!!! note "Tip"
    We provide a __check__ command for the tests, analytics and code style fixing, required for a pull request: run `composer check`

## Running the Test Suite

While developing, the test part is very important: if you apply a patch to the existing code, the test suite must run without errors or failures and if you add a new functionality, no one will consider it without tests.

Our test tool is [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) and we provide a script to launch it:

```bash
composer test
```
Since our command runs pest binary under the hood, you can pass all options to it via the `--` operator, i.e.:

```bash
composer test -- --stop-on-failure
```

You can also use pest directly:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest
```

## Code Coverage

We provides two commands to generate a code coverage report in _html_ or _xml_ format:

-  `composer coverage:html` command generates a code coverage report in _html_ format, into the directory `coverage/`
-  `composer coverage:clover` generates the report in _xml_ format, into `clover.xml` file.


## Static Analysis Tool

To prevent as many bugs as possible, we use a static analysis tool called [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/).
To launch it, run the following command:

```bash
composer analytics
```

After its analysis, Psalm outputs errors and issues with its suggestions on how to fix them.


## Coding Standard

We ship our script to easily fix coding standard errors, via [php-cs-fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/) tool.
To fix coding standard errors just run:

```bash
composer cs:fix
```

and to show the errors without fixing them, run:

```bash
composer cs:check
```

## Documentation Contributing

`susina/config-builder` documentation resides into the directory `docs/`. It's written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and it's generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).


### Install the Tools

If you want to contribute to the documentation, you should install the following tools, to generate it locally:

1. [Install MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation)
2. Install [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) by running: `pip install mkdocs-material`
   

### Markdown flavour

MkDocs uses [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) with some extensions active by default. It supports the standard markdown, markdown-extra and some of the Github-flavoured markdown features (i.e. syntax highlight). You can find detailed information on [https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#writing-with-markdown](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#writing-with-markdown).

Additionally, you could get a look at [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) documentation for further information.


### Admonition

[admonition](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/) extension helps to write beautiful notes or warnings or other (see the official documentation) with a syntax like the following:

```bash
!!! Danger
    Very dangerous operation!
```

which translates into the following:

!!! Danger
    Very dangerous operation!
